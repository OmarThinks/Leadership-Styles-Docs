- People don't leave jobs, they leave managers
- Personally, I resigned from 3 jobs due to bad leadership:
  1. After 1 day
  2. After 1 week
  3. After 2.5 months (Just after having one conversation with the leader)

- In your life you will be put in leadership positions
  - Man: Career and Family
  - Woman: With her children
- So, as much as you wish that you have a good leader, people under your leadership want you to become a better leader too
- A good leader is more likely to increase the retention (In work or family) and be more effective
